Write a program to implement a solution for the problem described in problem 1.
Use POSIX semaphores (semaphore.h) and threads (pthreads). Do not use shared memory. You
must use pthread mutexes to protect critical sections not binary semaphores. Use state machine
diagrams to design program to implement a solution for this problem. Make sure to hand in the
state diagrams that you used to design your program. I have posted a copy of the solution for
Smaugs world (with a somewhat different state machine from this terms) as an example of using
pthreads.
Each of the codes will be graded based on running the code for a series of scenarios. Code
that does not compile and run will receive a maximum of 15 points. Codes that correctly
complete some of the steps (e.g. only loading the ferry) will receive part marks if those
functions run correctly. Codes will be check for conformance with constraints and conditions
stated in the problem (e.g. Using the correct libraries).
